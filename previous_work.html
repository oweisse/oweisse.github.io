<h2> Regaining Lost Cycles with HotCalls: A Fast Interface for SGX Secure Enclaves</h2>

												<h3> Published at <a href="http://isca17.ece.utoronto.ca/doku.php"> ISCA 2017</a></h3> <h3><a href="ISCA17_Ofir_Weisse.pdf"> The paper,</a> <a href="https://github.com/oweisse/hot-calls"> Git repo</a></h3><p>
												
<p><b>Abstract:</b> Intel's SGX secure execution technology allows the running of computations on secret data using untrusted cloud servers. While recent work showed how to port applications and large scale computations to run under SGX, the performance implications of using the technology remains an open question. We present the first comprehensive quantitative study to evaluate the performance of SGX. We show that straightforward use of SGX library primitives for calling functions add between 8,200 - 17,000 cycles overhead, compared to 150 cycles of a typical system call. We quantify the performance impact of these library calls and show that in applications with high system calls frequency, such as <i>memcached</i>, <i>openVPN</i>, and <i>lighttpd</i>, which all have high bandwidth network requirements, the performance degradation may be as high as 79%. We  investigate the sources of this performance degradation by leveraging a new set of micro-benchmarks for SGX-specific operations such as entry-calls and out-calls, and encrypted memory I/O accesses. We leverage the insights we gain from these analyses to design a new SGX interface framework, <i>HotCalls</i>: <i>HotCalls</i> provide a 13-27x speedup over the default interface. It can easily be integrated into existing code, making it a practical solution. Compared to a baseline SGX  implementation of <i>memcached</i>, <i>openVPN</i>,  and <i>lighttpd</i>  - we  show that using the new interface  boosts the throughput by 2.6-3.7x, and reduce application response time by 62-74%. </p>

<p><b>Abstract:</b> Embedded systems depend on sensors to make automated decisions.  Resonant acoustic injection attacks are already known to cause malfunctions by disabling MEMS-based gyroscopes. However, an open question remains on how to move beyond denial of service attacks to achieve full adversarial control of sensor outputs.  Our work investigates how analog acoustic injection attacks can damage the digital <i> integrity</i>  of a popular type of sensor  in consumer devices: the capacitive MEMS accelerometer. Spoofing such sensors with intentional acoustic interference enables an out-of-spec pathway for attackers to deliver chosen digital values to microprocessors and embedded systems that blindly trust the unvalidated integrity of sensor outputs. Our contributions include (1) modeling the physics of malicious acoustic interference on MEMS
accelerometers, (2) discovering the circuit-level design flaws that cause the vulnerabilities by  measuring acoustic injection attacks on MEMS accelerometers as well as systems that depend on the sensors, and (3) two software-only defenses that mitigate many of the risks to the integrity of MEMS accelerometer outputs.
<br/><br/>
We characterize two classes of acoustic injection attacks: <i>output biasing </i> and <i>output control</i>. We test these attacks against 20 models of capacitive MEMS accelerometers representing the majority of the consumer market. Our experiments find that 75\% are vulnerable to output biasing, and 65\% are vulnerable to total output control. To illustrate end-to-end implications, we show how to inject fake steps into a Fitbit with a $5 speaker. In our <i>self-stimulating attack</i>, we play a malicious music file from a smartphone's speaker to control the on-board MEMS accelerometer trusted by a local app to pilot a toy RC car. In addition to offering hardware design fixes to eliminate the root causes of poor amplification and filtering, we introduce two low-cost defenses that mitigate output biasing attacks: <i>randomized sampling</i> and <i>180<sup>o</sup> out-of-phase sampling</i>. These software-only approaches mitigate attacks by exploiting the periodic and predictable nature of the malicious acoustic interference signal. Our results call into question the wisdom of allowing microprocessors and embedded systems to blindly trust that hardware abstractions alone will ensure the integrity of sensor outputs.

                        Template-based Tolerant Algebraic Side Channel Attacks (Template-TASCA) were sug- gested by Wool et al. in 2012. as a way of reducing the high data complexity of template attacks by coupling them with algebraic side-channel attacks.
